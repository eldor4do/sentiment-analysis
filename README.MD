The program trains a Naive Bayes classifier with the dataset provided by Sentiment140. The smaller of the two dataset has been included with the project.
The classifier can be used to get the sentiment of any tweet which is passed to it, and get the result as 'positive' or 'negative'.

###Installation Requirements:

- Python 2.7
- NLTK
- Stopwords, which can be obtained from nltk.download()

###Usage:

- Run the file sentiment.py with an individual tweet     being passed as a command line argument.
  Example:
	> python sentiment.py "your test tweet"
